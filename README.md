# R-CHRM
Recursive clustering by heterogeneity of repeated measures (R-CHRM) is a clustering algorithm that identifies heterogeneity for mutiple outcomes jointly. The function 'rchrmclus' performs clustering recursively at each visit and provides cluster partitions for each visit. 'rchrmclus' returns a nested list object. Suppose your object is called myclus then myclus[[1]] contains a number of data frames equal to the number of outcomes used. Each data frame contains the id vector provided, the repeated measures in wide format, and cluster variables assoicated with each visit. myclus[[2]] contains matrices equal to the number of outcomes used. If intermittent missing values were present in the data, each matrix will display the imputed values embeded in the data. Prior to running the algorithm, please make sure your ID vector 'id' is sorted in ascending order and that each longitudinal outcome (in wide format) is sorted according to your ID vector. See help document to see an example for complete data.
